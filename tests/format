The Purity Test:  datafile format

If you wish to create your own datafiles for the purity test,
follow these simple intructions.

Each block of text (questions, subject headers, etc.) is
enclosed in a "bracket" type of punctuation.

the styles of text blocks are:
	\{ plain text block \}
	\[ subject header \]
	\( test question \)
and	\< conclusion \>

Plain text blocks are just printed out character for character.

Subject headers are prefaced by the subject number, and then
printed as text blocks.

Questions are preceeded by their numbers, and then prompt the
user to answer the question, keeping track of the user's
current score.

Conclusions first calculate and print the user's score for the
test, then print out the conclusion as a text block.

If you wish to include any of the bracket punctuation in your
text, the "\\" character will "escape" the next character.

This means that to print a question with parentheses, you
would use the following format:
(have you ever created your own purity test \\(like this one\\)?)
the output would be this:
   1.  have you ever created your own purity test (like this one)?
and then it would have asked the user for her/his answer.
