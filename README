This is a "purity testing" progam.  There have been many
purity tests floating around the net, and this provides
a more or less automated way to take the tests, and keep
score, without having to always find pencil and paper.

It should be pretty straightforward to install.
edit the appropriate paths in the Makefile, and
make sure that definitions are correct in "pt.h".

After the program is compiled, put it in its directory, and
put the "tests" subdirectory into its library directory.
Several tests are included, as well as the datafile format,
in the event you want to add more tests.

It should run in both bsd and sysV, if the appropriate
definition in pt.h is made.  I've compiled it under both
4.3 BSD and A/UX 1.1.

This program is public domain.  Please don't charge for it.
If you improve it/fix it/etc, please let me know, so i can
keep my version up to date with everyone else's.
